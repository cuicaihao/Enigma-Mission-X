## Background
Inspired by [Enigma - Mission X Challenge](https://www.101computing.net/enigma-mission-x-challenge/), this repo is used to save the research and practice efforts in Different Cipher methods. The primary goals are using python programming language to achieve targets listed as follows:

- [x] Revisit Basic Cipher Methods
- [ ] Digital Enigma Cipher Machine Emulator
- [ ] Turing-Welchman Bombe Simulator
- [ ] Story Telling & Knowledge Sharing



## Revisit Basic Cipher Methods

Basic Letter 1 to 1 mapping like [Caesar Cipher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesar_cipher) is very easy to be hacked by comparing and matching letter based on statistic.

By create a multiply mappings and rolling the letter mapping by order, we can mapping the same letter to a different letter in each around, lead to a more even distributed ciphertext.
